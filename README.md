# Prework Study Guide Webpage Project

## Description

I was motivated to create this webpage in order to get a headstart on the course work. I wanted to be prepared for the official first day and by building this project, I learned about and became familiar with HTML, CSS, Git, and JavaScript. These can make the webpage more user friendly and interactive but it also makes the page more appealing by changing colors and designs. I learned that in order for a page to be functional, all three must be incorporated.
